# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose and Background
This data analysis was conducted to analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program (in the US) to determine if there is a bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members in relation to shoe purchases. 

### Results
  #### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
  In this particular dataset there were 22 paid reviews and 26987 unpaid reviews within the group of helpful reviews. 
  
  #### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  Of the Vine reviews there were 13 five star paid reviews and 14475 unpaid five star reviews. 
  
  #### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  99.9 of the non-Vine reviews were five stars while 0.1 percent of the reviews were Vine reviews. 
  
### Summary
Based on the results it can be assumed that there isn't a positivity bias in the reviews for the products in this dataset. This can be determined because many of the positive reviews provided came from individuals who were not a part of the Vine program.
